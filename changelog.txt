V0.7
Remove posision in token buffer and add it in EnergyData. Every time you call token.next() it will update EnergyData posision.
Update ObjectVariable so it not look after id every time it look after items but get the object of it.
Append method "arrayAppend(key, value)" to array variabel. The system call this mthod every time it append context to array
Append method "arrayGet(key)" to array class. It is called every time a context is trying to get from a array.
Append method "arrayNextKey" to array class. When it is called it will take the next key and return it. Will be uses in foreach.
Remove class "ArrayVariabel" and from the further work as string and int. A helper class will be created to help to get and append context.
If the string in agument in 'toInt' not can be converted to int the function will now be converted to -1.
Extrends more end one class 'class one extend too, tree, four{'
Append << and >> operater.
Append support for % operater.
Append support for hexadecimal.
Create aguments there contain all agument in a function when it is called.
Append config value "theread.use". When set to true (set true by default) the system is allow to use thered (but not the script when it theread is supportet). This config value can not be change by the script.

V0.6
 include more end one plugin in use. 'use "plugin", "plugin", "plugin";
 unset more end one variabel 'unset one, two, tree, four;'
 append option to load extra system plugin via dll files

 Add method 'updateRegex(string)' to update the regex string. Will throw errorif the string is empty.
 Push functions 'cosh', 'sinh' and 'tanh' to math plugin.
 Append method 'close' to Tcp class.
 Append "function<type>" to function agument type there tell what a function should return. If the function has no return type set it will return in a error.
Append method to Energy 'reaset' there empty VariabelDatabase and set status to'Normal' so it is as it was when it was interlized.
 Remove StringVariabel and Intvariabel. Pus functions to create them to 'TypeHandler' and create method 'instanceof(CVar, CVar)' to it for control if a object came from a Class or not.
 create Token isn there will look as this 'var isn var'. If it should work now it would look like this '!(var is var)' isn stay for 'is not'
 Create token 'protected'
 Add removeKey to array. Removed the key from the array.
 Add removeValue to array. Removed the value in the array.
 Append protectet method 'set' to string class. Can be uses to append string to string object. 
 Append protectet method 'set' to int class. Can be uses to append int to int object.
 Allow _ in beginning of variabel name.
---Bugfix---
If error file exists it will try to create it else it will try to write in it. 

V0.5 Takes 31875,7607ms old test [approved to release]. new 51062,8268ms
Rewriting the class handler.
---bugfix---
Error log handler only works when error function callback from the script site is set.
Call function/method from program dont push variabels name in variabel database

V0.4 Takes 23973,7051ms old test [approved to release]. new 36035,0161ms
  If the object has a method "toInt()" the variabel can be uses as int.
  If the class has a static method "toInt()" the class name can be uses as int.
  Replace int as class.
  Append a static method to int class "convert(data)" there can convert a given string to int, the defult return is 0.
  Set toInt in type plugin as not supportet.
  Only accept function and class in extern files.
  Append ? If the node befor ? Is true it will take the first node, else it will take after : it will look like this "bool ? node : node;"
  Append option to save error in a special files. 
  Append plugin "math" and pus cos tang and sin function to it.
  Change function/method call aguments so it interlize in specific length.;
  Append plugin "config" with class "Config" with static method "get(string)", "isScriptLock()" and "set(string, string)" "isLocked(string)". If the config is set by system it will only allow override if the config is not lock. When use set it is not lock and can be change allways
  If config "tcp.enable" set to true there will be tcp plugin available. 
  Update config handler so if you change value in the config system there has set to not be overridden in the script it will don't care what you say it will change the value and set it to not be overridden.
  Append scriptLock to config class. When it is set it will not allow the script to change the config.
  Append isScriptLock to config class so you can control if the script is allowed to change the config class,
  If config has a value "file.system.enable" it open a plugin to allow the script to touch the compourters file system.
----Bugfix----
If the system plugins has a item widt a global name it raise error. It shold never use the agument name becuse it never is used.

 Change ParserInterface so end is removed.
 Change so parseres not is interlize every time.
 Allow _ invariabels name.
 Add ^ to math section 2^3 = 8 
 Create function as name = function(){}; or test(function(){});
 Create class as name = class{}, test(class(){});, test = new class{} or test(new class{});
 Append new tokens break and continue. Break stop current task and continue break the running task and jump to next if there are any
 Append a new parser unset. When do this "i=0;unset i;" you remove i. You cant never remove function and class.

 Append string->format(string skapalon, array data); there work as sprintf in PHP
 Append hasKey and hasValue method to array and start last support cyclus for Array plugin.

 Append 'is' control if object is from the specifc class
 Throw a error when a non defult agument is after a defult value "A agument there has not a defult value can not be after a agument there has a defult value" in methods and function.
 Create a new token "func" as short cut for "function".
 ---Bugfix--
 when use object in if it can lead to error. 
 Files handler is broken. put functions without public indicator. 

V0.2 - Takes 19525,3693ms old test [approved to release]. new 30195,7674ms
 Create a file system where the script can parse other file and get class and function.
 When using anthoter file you beed to append public befor tokens "class" and "function" to indicate this class or/and function may be uses in anthoer file.
 Optimie Interprenter
 Append Posision to function and method call
 If the object or class has a method call toString() the name can be use as string variabel.
 optimizes the class parser
 Remove StringVariabel and write a static method there create a object of the class String. 
 Remove CallAgumentStack and use CVar[].
 Create a ScriptEndEvent there collect all object there want to be call after hole script is called.
 Create a ScriptTaskEvent there collect all object there can tell the Energy if the task is done. If not the Energy object will wait to call ScriptEndEvent.
 Change Class methods builder soo you can use Agugment with out first append AgumentStack object.
 Change Function builder so the caller use event and not now where it take a object.
 Change error system so it not throw it but save the error in the system and when called stop execution.
 Extends the Energy class so you can dispose the object so the script can handle ScriptTaskEvent and ScriptEndEvent.
 Change the ArrayVariabel so you can put context without key. The method put will automatically get a key and set the context to it.
 Create ForParser so you can use for(int=0;i<10;i++)
 Array will be change to object so you can use []->length();
 Append a ScriptConfig so you can use config. Script can change config, but you can disable it or disbale change on single config.
 Append method 'toLower()' and 'toUpper()' to string. toLower() will change HEY to hey and toUpper will change hey to HEY.
