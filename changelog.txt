 Remove StringVariabel and write a static method there create a object of the class String. 
 Remove CallAgumentStack and use CVar[].
 Create a ScriptEndEvent there collect all object there want to be call after hole script is called.
 Create a ScriptTaskEvent there collect all object there can tell the Energy if the task is done. If not the Energy object will wait to call ScriptEndEvent.
 Change Class methods builder soo you can use Agugment with out first append AgumentStack object.
 Change Function builder so the caller use event and not now where it take a object.
