 If the class has a static method "toInt()" the class name can be uses as int.
 Replace int as class.
 Append a static method to int class "convert(data)" there can convert a given type to int, the defult return is 0.
 Append a class when be uses the object can be uses as array
 Set toInt in type plugin as not supportet.

 Append ? If the node befor ? Is true it will take the first node, else it will take after : it will look like this "bool ? node : node;"
 Append option to save error in a special files. 
 Append a database drivers so you can connect to different databases like MySQl.
 Append plugin "math" and pus cos tang and sin function to it.
Change function/method call aguments so it interlize in specific length. When the length is trying to be overridden it will result in a error "Max aguments count is overriding.";
 Append plugin "config" with class "Config" with static method "get(string)", "isScriptLock()" and "set(string, string)" "isLocked(string)". If the config is set by system it will only allow override if the config is not lock. When use set it is not lock and can be change allways
If config "tcp.enable" set to true there will be tcp plugin available. 
 Update config handler so if you change value in the config system there has set to not be overridden in the script it will don't care what you say it will change the value and set it to not be overridden.
 Append scriptLock to config class. When it is set it will not allow the script to change the config.
 Append isScriptLock to config class so you can control if the script is allowed to change the config class,
 If config has a value "file.system.enable" it open a plugin to allow the script to touch the compourters file system.
 Set timeouts controls to the config. The parser control if the parser is taking to long time and set error when it take to long time
 Remove create in ClassMethod and ClassStaticMethod. It should create self and not when use create.
 Append switch.
 Append error lang file. Here you can tell where the language files is and use it to show error in yous language.

V0.3 [No further items is append to V0.3 the next new thing will be append in Version 0.4]
 Change ParserInterface so end is removed.
 Change so parseres not is interlize every time.
 Allow _ invariabels name.
 Add ^ to math section 2^3 = 8 
 Create function as name = function(){}; or test(function(){});
 Create class as name = class{};, test(class(){});, test = new class{}; or test(new class{});
 Append new tokens break and continue. Break stop current task and continue break the running task and jump to next if there are any
 Append a new parser unset. When do this "i=0;unset i;" you remove i. You cant never remove function and class.
 Append a new plugin random with a static class where method next and hash. 
 Append throw catch so you can throw errors.
 Append string->format(string skapalon, array data); there work as sprintf in PHP
 Append hasKey and hasValue method to array and start last support cyclus for Array plugin. 
 Append return type for function and method. look like this function string toString(){}. when do this the callable is lock to return the specific type. 
 Append plugin "parser" there create a function "version" there tell the version of parser.
 Append 'is' control if object is from the specifc class
 Append 'instanceof' control of the object is from the class
 Append extends. Extrens anthor class.
 Throw a error when a non defult agument is after a defult value "A agument there has not a defult value can not be after a agument there has a defult value" in methods and function.
 Create a new token "func" as short cut for "function".
 Optimize how ArrayVariabel works and standardized how it work so wee in V0.4 can create object in the script there can work as array.

V0.2 - Takes 19525,3693ms old test [approved to release]. new 30195,7674ms
 Create a file system where the script can parse other file and get class and function.
 When using anthoter file you beed to append public befor tokens "class" and "function" to indicate this class or/and function may be uses in anthoer file.
 Optimie Interprenter
 Append Posision to function and method call
 If the object or class has a method call toString() the name can be use as string variabel.
 optimizes the class parser
 Remove StringVariabel and write a static method there create a object of the class String. 
 Remove CallAgumentStack and use CVar[].
 Create a ScriptEndEvent there collect all object there want to be call after hole script is called.
 Create a ScriptTaskEvent there collect all object there can tell the Energy if the task is done. If not the Energy object will wait to call ScriptEndEvent.
 Change Class methods builder soo you can use Agugment with out first append AgumentStack object.
 Change Function builder so the caller use event and not now where it take a object.
 Change error system so it not throw it but save the error in the system and when called stop execution.
 Extends the Energy class so you can dispose the object so the script can handle ScriptTaskEvent and ScriptEndEvent.
 Change the ArrayVariabel so you can put context without key. The method put will automatically get a key and set the context to it.
 Create ForParser so you can use for(int=0;i<10;i++)
 Array will be change to object so you can use []->length();
 Append a ScriptConfig so you can use config. Script can change config, but you can disable it or disbale change on single config.
 Append method 'toLower()' and 'toUpper()' to string. toLower() will change HEY to hey and toUpper will change hey to HEY.

 Token dont convert comma (.) currect but just save the char code. 
 The int converter dont convert . Probely. It can convert it to , (the danish comma).
 
 --V0.1 is testet to time: 60547,4869ms in test case
