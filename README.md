# CowScript
A handwritten interprenter/lexer writen in c#

#The meaning of the CowScript.
The meaning is to use CowScript as extended you program. It is never meaning to work as singel program and there for it offers a options file system or TCP connection but you need enable it. It is a low level script language where options is minimal. You can always insert function or class to offer more options to the devolper.

#What can it be used to?
It can be use to extended you program options. The user can cretate function he needed. If you sant you can use it to create a Console program. 

# How to help developing to our lexer
You can alweys create pull request. 

# backwards compatibility

The parser will always try to offer older version of script to work in never version parser. But sometimes is new item better place to have functionality end the old way. So when a function or method is moving to anthor place it will continue be there but after 3 release after it is replaced it will be removed. But between 3 and 6 release it will throw an error there tell it not supportet and what way you will get it to work.

# CowScript offer class and function

In C# has Math.sin(double) and so on but wee will take benefits off function so Math.sin(double) is sin(int) in cowscript
More context will be added
