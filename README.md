# backwards compatibility

The parser will always try to offer older version of script to work in never version parser. But sometimes is new item better place to have functionality end the old way. So when a function or method is moving to anthor place it will continue be there but after 3 release after it is replaced it will be removed. But between 3 and 6 release it will throw an error there tell it not supportet and what way you will get it to work.

More context will be added
